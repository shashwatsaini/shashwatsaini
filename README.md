About Me:

I am a B.Tech. senior at Dayananda Sagar University, also pursuing an online B.S. degree in Data Science from IIT Madras. I have actively contributed to AI research through my works on neural networks & bioinformatics, including protein analysis and omics data. 

Apart from academia, I have built several projects leveraging AI in tasks such as LLM training & fine-tuning, image segmentation & object detection, and feature engineering. My expertise includes techniques such as neural networks, computer vision, natural language processing, and multi-agent systems.
